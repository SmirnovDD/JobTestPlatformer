# JobTestPlatformer

HELLO, PLEASE READ THIS FILE

This is my attempt at completing a test task. I have some important things to tell about it:

1. I do not have a gamepad, I used a new input system which should work. But I didn`t test it.
2. I did not try to make this project perfect, because it would take too much time. My goal was to show the programming principles that I know. I deliberately made
things "correctly" in some places and cut corners in others.
3. I am aware, that there are some bugs in the project, once again, my goal was not to make everything perfect here. I could easily spend a couple of weeks making
every system "correct".
Here are some things, that I would have done if it was a real project:
- make my own character controller to prevent problems with collision detection (like standing on top of enemies)
- make proper support for multiple levels, without references in scene
- improve Ui WIndows system
- make proper initializer instead of using a mix of zenject and finding objects in scene
- have managers and ui init in boot scene and make them persistent
- get rid of all crutches
- get rid of all bugs that I`ve found
- and so on..

With that said, I hope that I could demonstrate, that I understand  OOP, know how to use patterns, have SOLID principles in mind and so on.
